# VSCode Client for STAN

VSCode extension for interfacing with the STAN language server. Modified from the
basic LSP example from the VSCode docs.

## Development

You should have the VSCE npm package installed (`npm install -g @vscode/vsce`). Then,
run `vsce package` to generate the bundle.

Once the extension is in a more complete state I may publish it. But I'm just learning!
